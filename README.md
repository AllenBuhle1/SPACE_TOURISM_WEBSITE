### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this multi-page space tourism website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information
